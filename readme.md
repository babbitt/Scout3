#Team 334 Web Scout
The inital commit.
### What it is
A boilerplate for FRC scouting apps. Provides you with powerful tools to build your own WebApp and get the data from your users.
### How it works
I've built a bunch of custom tags that you can import into your project, it's just a single html import into your code to minimize my impact. Behind all the magic is a tiny set of css and javascript files that add all of the features of the Scout3 lib.
#### Why is it not done yet?
Well this is version .0002 (super-alpha) which means this won't be released for a long time. I hope on having it done for 2017 game reveal. If that falls through then I'm aiming for end of season 2017.
#### Library Used:
[X-Tag](http://x-tag.github.io/) for custom html tags made easy.
#### What I've done so far
I've made some of the components that go into the boilerplate.
