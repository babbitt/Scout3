#Team 334 Web Scout
The inital commit.
### What it is
A web platform that allows you to take scouting modules and create a webApp from them that can be used to input scouting data. In addition I am hoping to add analytics functionality so that you can also build a strong data viewer.
#### Why is it not done yet?
Well this is version .0001 (super-alpha) which means this won't be released for a long time. I hope on having it done for 2017 game reveal. If that falls through then I'm aiming for end of season 2017.
