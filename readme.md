#Scout3
The (not quite) initial commit
**Note: Please read the Docs. It's a small page and it explains the ins and out of the boilerplate. Its a simple one to use, but has some very important behaviors that will lead to forever frustration if you don't read the docs.
### What it is
A web boilerplate that allows you to create really powerful scouting modules and create a webApp in just a few lines of code. In addition I am hoping to add analytics functionality so that you can also build a strong data viewer.
### How it works
I've built a bunch of custom tags that you can import into your project, it's just a single html import(still working on that) into your code to minimize my impact. Behind all the magic is a tiny set of css and javascript files that add all of the features of the Scout3 lib.
#### Why is it not done yet?
Well this is version .0003 (super-alpha) which means this won't be released for a long time. I hope on having it done for 2017 game reveal. If that falls through then I'm aiming for end of season 2017.
#### Libraries Used:
[X-Tag](http://x-tag.github.io/) for custom html tags made easy.
[Jquery](http://jquery.com) you know what it is.
#### What I've done so far
I've made most of the components needed for the app. Now working on some analitical views to be used with data
